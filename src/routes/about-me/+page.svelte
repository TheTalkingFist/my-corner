<h1>Hi!</h1>

<Blurb blurb="
    You probably know me as The Talking Fist! I'm an aspiring game developer, programmer and artist, more on those later.

    I like to think I'm friendly and fun to be around. Making people happy is a thing that I just happen to like to do. I hope I'm good at that...

    My favourite games change from time to time. Right now, I'm into Genshin Impact, Minecraft, TABS and The Binding of Isaac.

    I have a pretty good computer, mostly held back by the CPU which I hope to change soon. I mainly work on Windows 11 and Fedora 42 with Hyprland, switching between the two whenever I feel like it.

    I'm learning to cook. I'm not good at that yet.
