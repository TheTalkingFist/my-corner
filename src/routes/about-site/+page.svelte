<h1>What's up with this site?</h1>


<Blurb blurb="
    This site may look a little bare at the moment, and you're right. This will be my second ever project with Svelte.

    I mainly want this site to be a place for me to show off my projects and my days. If I'm ever feeling sentimental, I can look through this site to see how far I've come.

    And, in the off-chance that this site, or even I, become popular, then perhaps this place can serve, too, as a sign for others to see that they can go way, way farther than where they are now should they believe in themselves.

    In any chance, I'm hoping I can commit to this being a weekly update.
